Btw, I am in the process of contributing cancellation support for version 7 of the the popular [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/tree/v7) framework for Swift. The ['Cancel' for PromiseKit pull request](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/pull/899) has been in the works for around 9 months.

This proposal is inspired by the PromiseKit work.  I mention PromiseKit to give some confidence that this pitch has a basis in reality.
